## 🎯 About Me

I'm a Computer Engineering student (2022–2026) passionate about **bridging the gap between ML research and production deployment**. While others stop at training models, I build complete systems that deliver value in the real world.

```python
class HenilBhavsar:
    def __init__(self):
        self.role = "AI/ML Engineer"
        self.focus = ["Production ML", "Generative AI", "Backend Systems"]
        self.motto = "Models are just the beginning, deployment is where magic happens"
    
    def current_mission(self):
        return "Building AI systems that scale and solve real problems"
```

**What sets me apart:** I don't just build models — I architect end-to-end AI solutions with robust APIs, intelligent pipelines, and production-grade deployments.
